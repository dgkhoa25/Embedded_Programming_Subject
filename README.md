This project is created based on the subject named "Embedded Programming" (Lập trình nhúng).

The name of project is "Designing a remote vehicle control model via rf and bluetooth protocol".

******************************** ABSTRACT ********************************

  - Helps in basic understanding of ST microcontrollers by controlling single components such as motor control, multi-state programming, and wireless communication setup.
  - Create a general overview model so we can visualize the design for an embedded system, which is essentially just simple parts assembled to suit.
  - Give team members the opportunity to learn basic wireless protocol standards and hardware programming for the system.
